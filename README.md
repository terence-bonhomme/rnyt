## cautious

- don't delete the RemNote YT
  - deleted rems are not really deleted in RemNote
- plugin name
  - if you don't want the settings, use -np in the plugin name : example rnyt -np    
  - use an useless name like "rnyt" to avoid noise when you search in RemNote
- the plugin can't modify the rems, so it won't correct the misplaced rems
- be careful when you edit you rems into RemNote
  - the timestamps are mandatory on the top level
  - follow the chronological order
  - the child notes with a timestamp are inserted before child notes without a timestamp
- the child notes are linked to the current chapter, you can change it into RemNote
- be careful about the focus
  - check the keyboard switch
  - plugin in inline mode have issues, because RemNote takes the focus again and again, until you reload the tab
  - RemNote won't let you use your keyboard into the plugin if you click on a sibbling rem : reload the tab
  - if you edit the child rems : fold these after
- show one plugin at a time to avoid duplicates
- in the settings
  - only change the numbers
  - don't write units
